# pugo
Pugo is...
- A simple static site generator
- A Hugo knock-off simplified to only handle basic stuff
- A boot.dev guided project that maybe developed further one day (big if, tho)

> About the guided project, refer to: https://www.boot.dev/learn/build-static-site-generator (kudos for the amazing guide!)
